-editor view:
actually editing cells and using the text bar don't work (we screwed something up and can't figure
out what)
scrolling also doesn't really work

-visual view:
scrolling also doesn't really work

-UI:
fairly simple, each cell is it's own button that a user (should be able to) can click on and change
either right in the cell or in the text bar. A user needs to press enter for the changes to be made.
